- Measured with lighthouse
- Measured FPS for large number of rows I used FPS measuring tool of chrome - It gave average FPS of **55** (for the table scrolls alone) âœ¨.

## Optimization

- I optimized this app by memoizing things where needed like for the result table which made my app to not crash for large number of rows.
- Limited rows to 50 by default to improve speed and avoid unnecessary rendering of rows which might not be needed.
- Purged all unused tailwind styles' classes in prod build.
